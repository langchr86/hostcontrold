.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBoping\fR uses ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 \s-1ECHO_REQUEST\s0 packets to measure a hosts
reachability and the network latency. In contrast to the original \fIping\fR\|(8)
utility \fBoping\fR can send \s-1ICMP\s0 packets to multiple hosts in parallel and wait
for all \s-1ECHO_RESPONSE\s0 packets to arrive. In contrast to the \fBfping\fR utility
(\s-1URL\s0 is listed in \*(L"\s-1SEE\s0 \s-1ALSO\s0\*(R") \fBoping\fR can use both, IPv4 and IPv6
transparently and side by side.
.PP
\&\fBnoping\fR is an ncurses-based front-end to \fIliboping\fR which displays ping
statistics online and highlights aberrant round-trip times if the terminal
supports colors.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-4\fR" 4
.IX Item "-4"
Force the use of IPv4.
.IP "\fB\-6\fR" 4
.IX Item "-6"
Force the use of IPv6.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIcount\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c count"
Send (and receive) \fIcount\fR \s-1ICMP\s0 packets, then stop and exit.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fIinterval\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i interval"
Send one \s-1ICMP\s0 packet (per host) each \fIinterval\fR seconds. This can be a
floating-point number to specify sub-second precision.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR \fIttl\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t ttl"
Set the \s-1IP\s0 Time to Live to \fIttl\fR. This must be a number between (and
including) 1\ and\ 255. If omitted, the value \fB64\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIaddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I address"
Set the source address to use. You may either specify an \s-1IP\s0 number or a
hostname. You \fBcannot\fR pass the interface name, as you can with \s-1GNU\s0's
\&\fIping\fR\|(8) \- use the \fB\-D\fR option for that purpose.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIinterface name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D interface name"
Set the outgoing network device to use.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f filename"
Instead of specifying hostnames on the command line, read them from
\&\fIfilename\fR. If \fIfilename\fR is \fB\-\fR, read from \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fIoping\fR is installed with the SetUID-bit, it will set the effective \s-1UID\s0 to
the real \s-1UID\s0 before opening the file. In the special (but common) case that
\&\fIoping\fR is owned by the super-user (\s-1UID\s0\ 0), this means that privileges
are temporarily dropped before opening the file, in order to prevent users from
reading arbitrary files on the system.
.Sp
If your system doesn't provide \fIsaved set-user IDs\fR (this was an optional
feature before \s-1POSIX\s0\ 2001), the behavior is different because it is not
possible to \fItemporarily\fR drop privileges. The alternative behavior is: If the
real user \s-1ID\s0 (as returned by \fIgetuid\fR\|(2)) and the effective user \s-1ID\s0 (as
returned by \fIgeteuid\fR\|(2)) differ, the only argument allowed for this option is
\&\*(L"\-\*(R" (i.e. standard input).
.IP "\fB\-Q\fR \fIqos\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Q qos"
Specify the \fIQuality of Service\fR (QoS) for outgoing packets. This is a
somewhat tricky option, since the meaning of the bits in the IPv4 header has
been revised several times.
.Sp
The currently recommended method is \fIDifferentiated Services\fR which is used in
IPv6 headers as well. There are shortcuts for various predefined
\&\fIper-hop behaviors\fR (PHBs):
.RS 4
.IP "\fBbe\fR" 4
.IX Item "be"
Selects the \fIBest Effort\fR behavior. This is the default behavior.
.IP "\fBef\fR" 4
.IX Item "ef"
Selects the \fIExpedited Forwarding\fR (\s-1EF\s0) per-hop behavior, as defined in
\&\fI\s-1RFC\s0\ 3246\fR. This \s-1PHB\s0 is characterised by low delay, low loss and low
jitter, i.e. high priority traffic.
.IP "\fBva\fR" 4
.IX Item "va"
Selects the \fIVoice Admitted\fR (\s-1VA\s0) per-hop behavior, as defined in
\&\fI\s-1RFC\s0\ 5865\fR. This traffic class is meant for \fIVoice over \s-1IP\s0\fR (VoIP)
traffic which uses \fICall Admission Control\fR (\s-1CAC\s0) for reserving network
capacity.
.IP "\fBaf\fR\fIc\fR\fIp\fR" 4
.IX Item "afcp"
Selects one of 12\ differentiated services code points (DSCPs), which are
organized in four \fIclasses\fR with three \fIpriorities\fR each. Therefore, \fIc\fR
must be a number between\ 1 through\ 4 and \fIp\fR must be a number
between\ 1 through\ 3, for example \*(L"af13\*(R", \*(L"af22\*(R" and \*(L"af41\*(R". In each
class, the lower priority number takes precedence over the higher priority
number.
.IP "\fBcs\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "csn"
Selects one of the eight \fIClass Selector\fR PHBs. \fIn\fR is a number
between\ 0 through\ 7. The class selectors have been defined to be
compatible to the \fIPrecedence\fR field in the IPv4 header as defined in
\&\fI\s-1RFC\s0\ 791\fR. Please note that \*(L"cs0\*(R" is synonymous to \*(L"be\*(R".
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The old definition of the same bits in the IPv4 header was as \fIType of
Service\fR (ToS) field, specified in \fI\s-1RFC\s0\ 1349\fR. It defined four possible
values which have appropriate aliases. Please note that this use of the bits is
\&\fBdeprecated\fR and the meaning is limited to IPv4!
.IP "\fBlowdelay\fR" 4
.IX Item "lowdelay"
Minimize delay
.IP "\fBthroughput\fR" 4
.IX Item "throughput"
Maximize throughput
.IP "\fBreliability\fR" 4
.IX Item "reliability"
Maximize reliability
.IP "\fBmincost\fR" 4
.IX Item "mincost"
Minimize monetary cost
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Alternatively, you can also specify the byte manually. You can use either a
decimal number (0\-255), a hexadecimal number (0x00\-0xff) or an octal number
(00\-0377) using the usual \*(L"0x\*(R" and \*(L"0\*(R" prefixes for hexadecimal and octal
respectively.
.Sp
The printed lines will contain information about the QoS field of received
packets if either a non-standard QoS setting was used on outgoing packets or if
the QoS byte of incoming packets is not zero. In other words, the QoS
information is omitted if both, the outgoing and the incoming QoS bytes are
zero. The received byte is always interpreted as
\&\fIDifferentiated Services Code Point\fR (\s-1DSCP\s0) and
\&\fIExplicit Congestion Notification\fR (\s-1ECN\s0), even if the deprecated
\&\fIType of Service\fR (ToS) aliases were used to specify the bits of outgoing
packets.
.RE
.SH "COLORS"
.IX Header "COLORS"
If supported by the terminal, \fInoping\fR will highlight the round-trip times
(\s-1RTT\s0) using the colors green, yellow and red. Green signals RTTs that are in
the \*(L"expected\*(R" range, yellow marks moderately unusual times and times that
differ a lot from the expected value are printed in red.
.PP
The information used to categorize round-trip times is the \fIaverage\fR
round-trip time and the \fIstandard deviation\fR. RTTs that differ from the
average by less than the standard deviation are considered to be \*(L"normal\*(R" and
are printed in green. Times that differ from the average more than the standard
deviation but less than twice the standard deviation are considered \*(L"moderately
unusual\*(R" and are printed in yellow. Times differing more than twice the
standard deviation from the average are considered to be \*(L"unusual\*(R" and are
printed in red.
